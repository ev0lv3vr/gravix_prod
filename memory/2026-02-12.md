## Sprint 10: Production Hardening — COMPLETE ✅
- **Commit:** 687fd98 (pushed to main, gate check passed)
- **Completed ~1:30 AM PST** via sub-agent
- Error monitoring: structured backend logging + React error boundaries
- Rate limiting: custom in-memory limiter (10/min AI, 5/min auth, 60/min stats)
- API caching: Cache-Control headers on public stats (5m), cases (2m), no-cache on health
- SEO: OpenGraph/Twitter cards, per-page metadata, robots.txt, sitemap.xml
- All gates passed (tsc, lint, build)
- **Post-deploy TODOs:** OG image (1200×630), set NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL, monitor error logs 48h
- **All 10 sprints now complete!**

## Morning Check (8:50 AM)
- Backend health confirmed: v2.0.0, all V2 routes live (admin, cron, knowledge engine)
- Stats endpoint working: 1 analysis completed, knowledge engine ready for data
- Migration 005 confirmed run (knowledge_evidence_count fields exist)
- **Created cron jobs:**
  - `gravix-aggregate-knowledge` — daily 4 AM, runs aggregate-knowledge + aggregate-metrics
  - `gravix-send-followups` — daily 10 AM, sends feedback followup emails
  - CRON_SECRET generated: `7tAvLEsrI5uGNSFa0WgauloQkICM-_uRDXD5HaE6Cbw`
  - ⚠️ **Ev needs to add CRON_SECRET to Render env vars** for crons to authenticate
- **MEMORY.md updated** — was 2 days stale, caused me to give wrong sprint status
- **AGENTS.md updated** — added trust hierarchy rule: git > daily files > MEMORY.md
- Error log: memory staleness caused incorrect sprint status report to Ev

## Gluemasters Site Audit & Fixes (9:32 AM)

### Full site audit completed — crawled all pages
- Saved to `gluemasters-audit-2026-02-12.md`

### Fixes Applied via Shopify Admin API:

**P0: Pricing Display Fixed ✅**
- 14 variants had backwards compare_at_price (lower than current price)
- Set all compare_at_price to null — products now show clean single price
- Affected: ALL 16oz, 8oz, 2oz CA glues + Accelerator + Gel + 20g products

**P0: Broken Links Fixed ✅**
- Fixed links across 9 pages: Viscosity Guide, B2B, Technical Resources, all 6 use-case landing pages
- Replaced 6 types of broken product URLs with correct legacy Shopify slugs
- Also fixed /pages/contact → /pages/contact-us

**Still needs manual fix (API scope limitation):**
- Refund policy page links to gravixadhesives.com — needs `write_legal_policies` scope
- Ev needs to update in Shopify Admin → Settings → Policies → Refund Policy
  Change: `gravixadhesives.com/pages/contact-us` → `gluemasters.com/pages/contact-us`

### Remaining issues (not API-fixable, need theme work):
- Collection pages render empty (/collections/16-ounce-bottle-variable-viscosity etc.)
- Customer Reviews page is blank (review app integration broken, 1,183 reviews hidden)
- No reviews displayed on product pages
- 6 of ~16 products OOS without back-in-stock notify
- Contact page has wrong zip code (72744 = Arkansas, not Seattle 98104)
- About Us page is stale (2022), Our Story page is much better

### Shopify API Access
- Store: gravix.myshopify.com
- Token: in moneysamurai/api/.env (Clyde app)
- Can: read/write products, variants, pages, orders
- Cannot: write legal policies (need scope upgrade)

### Homepage Redesign — B2C Sections Added (10:28 AM)
Pushed new homepage template via Shopify Theme Asset API (theme 131948675249, Empire).

**New sections added (in order):**
1. **"What Are You Working On?"** — 6 use-case cards (Woodworking, Coral Fragging, Crafts & Models, Furniture Repair, 3D Printing, Manufacturing) linking to existing landing pages
2. **"Not Sure Which Viscosity?"** — 4-column quick selector (Ultra Thin → Thick) with "Most Popular" and "Best Seller" badges, links to product pages + full viscosity guide
3. **"Shop by Size"** — 3 cards (2oz Try It / 8oz Project / 16oz Pro Value) linking to collection pages, with "Best Value" badge on 16oz
4. **Social Proof strip** — 5-star rating, Shark Tank testimonial quote, stats (4.7★, 1,300+ reviews, 50K+ bottles)

**Section order now:** Hero → Highlights bar → Use Cases → Viscosity Selector → Best Sellers → Shop by Size → Reviews carousel (Opinew) → Social Proof → B2B callout → Video → Reef2Reef → Newsletter

**Also updated highlights bar:** Changed "2,000+ 5-Star Reviews" to "4.7★ from 1,300+ Reviews" (accurate) and "100% Satisfaction Guarantee" to "Made & Stocked in Chicago" (differentiation)

**Shopify admin creds received:** david@gluemasters.com (stored temporarily for session)
**Review app:** Opinew (opinew-reviews) — carousel block on homepage, but reviews page empty

### Font/Contrast Bug Fix — All Pages (11:50 AM)
**Bug:** White text (`color:#fff`) applied to paragraph text in sections with light backgrounds (#f8f9fa, white, #f0f8ff). Made text invisible.

**Root cause:** Pages were generated with `color:#fff` on body text paragraphs — seems like a generation error where hero section styling leaked into content sections.

**Fixed across 11 pages:**
- CA Glue for Woodworking (18 instances)
- CA Glue for 3D Printing (22)
- CA Glue for Manufacturing (33)
- CA Glue for Coral Fragging (4)
- CA Glue for Crafts/Models/RC (4)
- CA Glue for Furniture Repair (4)
- B2B page (3)
- Our Story (2)
- Technical Resources (25)
- FAQ (8)
- SDS/TDS Documentation (23+)

**Fix:** Changed `color:#fff` → `color:#444` on paragraph text, preserved white text in dark hero gradient sections (detected via opacity:0.95 pattern). Also fixed #d0d7de and #aaa low-contrast text on FAQ and SDS pages.

**Remaining false positives:** Badge/pill elements with colored backgrounds + white text (correct contrast) — no action needed.

### Gravix: Knowledge Engine Bug Fix + Schema (1:00 PM)
- CRON_SECRET added to Render by Ev, verified working (200 OK)
- Found bug: code referenced `feedback` table instead of `analysis_feedback` — fixed in 99211a6
- Found deeper bug: `analysis_feedback` DB schema missing many columns the code expects (spec_id, was_helpful, actual_root_cause, etc.)
- Created migration 006 (ed50abc) — **Ev needs to run on Supabase**
- OG image created for Gravix (1200×630, dark theme) — wired in layout.tsx
- All parked for later per Ev's request

### Midday Check (2:00 PM)
- Set NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://www.gravix.com on Vercel (gravix-prod) ✅
- Pushed empty commit to trigger Vercel redeploy with new env var (372fe67)
- Cleaned ~30 temp files from workspace root → /tmp/gluemasters-scratch/
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md — marked completed items, added migration 006 blocker
- Backend health: v2.0.0 ✅, Render stable
- MoneySamurai: clean, some uncommitted sync script tweaks (normal)
- Linked frontend/ to gravix-prod Vercel project for future CLI ops

### Gluemasters: Brand Merge Execution (1:24 PM)
**Formascope brand fonts uploaded to Shopify:**
- Brandon Grotesque (Regular, Bold, Black) → headings
- TT Norms Regular → body text
- Intensa Bold Condensed + Speed → logo/display
- All converted OTF → WOFF2, uploaded as theme assets
- @font-face + typography overrides injected into theme.liquid

**Brand color merge applied:**
- All CTAs/buttons → magenta (#E91E76) — best-seller Thick color
- Links → royal blue (#2B5CAB) — Thin label color
- Footer → navy (#1a1a2e) with white text
- Checkout → magenta accent + buttons
- Homepage viscosity cards → exact bottle colors (cyan, blue, green, magenta)
- Theme settings_data.json updated globally
- Homepage template sections updated
- Viscosity Guide + B2B page colors updated
- Landing pages color pass in progress (6 pages)

**Other fixes:**
- Contact page zip: 72744 → 98104 ✅
- Collection pages confirmed NOT broken (JS-rendered, products present)
- Best Sellers product images: white boxes in headless browser only (lazy-load issue, works for real users)

### Gluemasters: Design Plan Completion (afternoon)
- Landing page color pass completed (6 use-case pages, 218 replacements)
- Product pages: viscosity badges + specs bars added across all products + trust badges strip appended
- Viscosity analogies corrected: Ultra Thin=Like Water, Thin=Light Syrup, Medium=Like Motor Oil, Thick=Like Honey
- About Us page was empty → populated with Our Story content
- Opinew fix: `opinew_head` snippet rendered in `layout/theme.liquid` so reviews JS loads
- Free shipping progress bar added to cart (`snippets/free-shipping-bar.liquid` rendered in `sections/static-cart.liquid`)
- OOS audit: 10/20 products OOS; negative inventory: CA Gel 20g (-6), Thick 2oz (-1)

### Gluemasters: SEO Execution (afternoon)
- Homepage meta title/description set (shop global title_tag/description_tag)
- Product SEO metafields set (title_tag + description_tag) for 17 products
- Key collections renamed + descriptions added (6 collections incl 2oz/8oz/16oz size collections)
- Product URL handles shortened for all 20 products (Shopify auto 301s inconsistent via API)
- Created 20 direct redirects `/products/old-handle` → `/products/new-handle`
- Added `aggregateRating` to Product JSON-LD schema in `snippets/structured-data.liquid` using Opinew metafields
- Updated internal links to new short URLs (homepage + 7 pages)
- Found issue: Shopify does NOT redirect collection-scoped URLs (`/collections/*/products/old-handle`) → created ~170 collection-scoped redirects (hit API rate limits but core 2oz links fixed)

### Gluemasters: Content Marketing
- Published 6 new SEO blog posts under /blogs/articles:
  - Coral fragging CA glue guide
  - Pen turning CA finish guide
  - CA glue vs epoxy
  - Fix 3D prints with CA
  - Viscosity pillar article
  - Industrial CA for manufacturing
- Google Search Console sitemap submission requires manual access (no API creds); ping endpoint 404 (deprecated)

## Evening Session (7:30 PM - 9:30 PM) — Gluemasters Creative Assets + Label Pipeline

### Google Drive Assets Download
- Ev shared Google Drive folder: `1HzhjqGrgkfkangl8ameNDMNzKPgn4-pG` (Formascope creative assets)
- First attempt with `gdown` — got 46 files before Google rate-limited hard (most folders empty)
- Pushed initial 46 files (bottle specs + BFCM banners) as commit `4f7820c`
- Ev then shared zip link: `1FXn8YSHLKgWzsQ8vHqmlFjuVOyKCwmKo` (1.95 GB)
- Downloaded zip successfully via gdown, unzipped → 397 files / 1.4 GB
- **GitHub push issues:** HTTPS kept breaking on large pushes (SSL "bad record mac" errors)
  - Fix: `git config core.compression 0` helped for medium pushes
  - For videos: had to commit + push each MP4 individually (one-by-one loop with retries)
  - One file excluded: `A+2.mp4` (123MB > GitHub 100MB limit, needs LFS)
- **Final state:** All 397 files pushed across ~15 commits, `main` fully up to date at `4b1a6ef`
- Path in repo: `creative-assets/Creative Assets/`

### Asset Inventory (from zip)
- **Formascope source assets:** Labels (.ai), logos (SVG/EPS/PNG), fonts (6 OTF), favicons, media kit (Amazon renders, bundles), business card, concept presentations (4 PDFs)
- **Banners:** BFCM (Black Friday/Cyber Monday), Buy with Prime, SB
- **Listing images:** Store PXDs, product JPGs, YouTube banners, Bundles 1-10 PXDs
- **Videos:** CA glue promo videos (Advertising 1-3, Thick, Thin, Ultra Thin), music tracks (no copyright), video screenshots (25 PSDs + 36 stills)
- **Social:** Instagram (sources + posts), LinkedIn (cover + profile)
- **Manufacturing shoots:** Gel production + epoxy (mostly empty due to rate limiting on first pass)
- **Website content:** B2B page HTML, test grids

### Pump Accelerator 8oz Label Project
- Ev clarified: pump-action ACCELERATOR (not debonder) — same formula as existing aerosol, new packaging
- **Competitor research completed** (5 brands):
  - Starbond "Pinocchio" Pump 8oz — $14.50 (own site), $19.99 (Walmart). Key claims: ergonomic nozzle, softer mist, less brittle, no whitening
  - BSI Insta-Set — strawberry scented, 6-8 sec cure
  - TotalBond (TotalBoat) — marine-focused, "cures on contact"
  - ASI Quick Tac 2 — B2B/industrial positioning
  - Chem-Set Quick Tac II — stone repair focused
- **UPC received:** 199874971148 — official GS1 EPS + hi-res PNG saved
- **Label copy draft v1 written** — front (purple diamond, ACCELERATOR/CYANOACRYLATE, PUMP SPRAY) + back (features, directions, warnings, UPC area)
- **Safety note:** Pump bottle = WARNING not DANGER (no pressurized container hazards H222/H229). Flammable liquid H226 + skin sensitization H317 remain.
- **PDF proof generated** — `pump-accelerator-8oz-label-v1.pdf` with Helvetica fallback (brand fonts are CFF/PostScript OTF, can't embed in reportlab)
- **Discussed 3 paths for print-ready:** A) Freelancer in Illustrator, B) Send back to Formascope, C) HTML→PDF with headless Chrome
- Files in repo: `labels/pump-accelerator-8oz/` (RESEARCH.md, LABEL-COPY-DRAFT.md, generate-label.py, PDF proof, UPC EPS + PNG)
- **Still needed:** Bottle dimensions from Xtralok, model number confirmation, "Made in ___", Ev's copy edits

### Key Lessons
- `git config core.compression 0` fixes LibreSSL SSL_read errors on large HTTPS pushes
- For files >50MB, push one file per commit with retry loops
- gdown gets rate-limited fast on public Google Drive folders — zip download is more reliable
- Formascope fonts are all CFF/PostScript OTF — reportlab can't embed them, need conversion or different renderer
- Brand font files: brandon_grotesque (black/bold/regular), intensa (bold_condensed/speed), tt_norms (regular)
