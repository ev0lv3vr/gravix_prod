# 2026-02-10 — Tuesday

## Summary
First full day of operation. Heavy development day across multiple projects. BOOTSTRAP.md still present (intro conversation hasn't happened yet — agent running entirely via cron jobs and direct commands).

## Gravix V2 — Frontend Rebuild ⭐
- Overnight: Sub-agents built initial frontend scaffold (backend + frontend completed via nightly build)
- Morning: Gravix V2 deployed to production — gravix.com live on Vercel + backend on Render
- Fixed Vercel root directory issue that was blocking deployment
- **Urgent hotfix** (~4:36 PM): Scroll animations breaking visibility on mobile, empty sections, excessive whitespace
  - Root cause: `opacity-0` initial state + IntersectionObserver relying on JS
  - Fix: Progressive enhancement — content visible by default, animations as enhancement
  - Pushed commit `ea63cde` to main → Vercel auto-deploy
- **Late afternoon (~5:28 PM):** Spawned sub-agent to rebuild frontend to match detailed SPEC.md
  - First pass (Sonnet): 85% complete — all 8 landing components, spec engine, pricing, dashboard, history, case library, settings
  - Respawned on Opus 4.6 per Барин's request — still running at EOD
  - Remaining: Failure Analysis page, Case Detail, Feedback Landing
- **Still needed:** Stripe webhook secret, Resend API key, Supabase JWT secret

## Gluemasters (Shopify)
- Zero sales today — prompted marketing review
- Full homepage audit done as a marketer:
  - Dead/empty sections ("See Glue Masters in Action" with nothing)
  - Fake sale pricing (same price struck-through)
  - No product differentiation (all 4 products look identical)
  - No social proof visible despite "2,000+ 5-Star Reviews" claim
  - No use-case guidance for dual audience (B2B + consumer)
- Proposed dual-audience segmentation (For Your Shop / For Your Business)
- **Барин said "Build it in Shopify"** — Shopify CLI auth in progress at EOD (waiting for device code approval: JBQF-PBPR)

## ShipBob Replacement Orders — Tracking Saga
- **All day:** Multiple cron jobs checking tracking for 2 hazmat DG replacement orders
  - Steven Kroll (#334876915) — Ontario 2 (CA), 6x 16oz Thick → Fort Collins, CO
  - Jennifer Reese (#335025910) — Buford (GA), 4x 16oz Thick → North Charleston, SC
- Morning checks (9:45 AM through 10:11 AM): Both stuck at "Picked" with no tracking
- Discovery: Twin Lakes (WI) orders shipped same-day with tracking — Ontario CA and Buford GA stalling
- **3:00 PM: Tracking finally appeared!**
  - Kroll: `9239590371977601517289` (USPS/OSM) — LabeledCreated
  - Reese: `9239590318424206216686` (USPS/OSM) — LabeledCreated
  - Emails sent from sales@gluemasters.com to both customers
- ⚠️ Duplicate emails sent (~3 each) due to:
  1. Himalaya SMTP save-to-Sent error causing retries
  2. Cron job firing again at 3:03 PM
- **Fixed:** himalaya config updated with `save-copy = false` (Gmail auto-saves)
- Also found: Jaan Malik replacement (335026690) has tracking `9239590318424206216709`

## MoneySamurai
- 4:00 PM: Automated data sync triggered (products, orders, inventory, financial, restock)
- Backend health: OK (`v0.1.0`)

## Infrastructure Issues
- Cron gateway RPC timing out repeatedly throughout morning (5+ attempts)
- Workaround: Added tracking checks to HEARTBEAT.md
- Gateway restarted via SIGUSR1 — cron eventually stabilized by afternoon

## Morning Briefing (9:00 AM cron)
- Delivered summary to Telegram
- Top priorities outlined: ShipBob tracking, Gravix V2 wiring, product images

## Midday Check (2:00 PM cron)
- All systems green
- Gravix V2 live announcement
- ShipBob replacements shipped + reimbursement invoice ($336) submitted
- Identified quick wins: Viscosity Finder Quiz upload, product image fixes, B2B outreach

## Gravix V2 — UI Spec Document Received (~5:43 PM)
- Барин shared comprehensive page-by-page component specification PDF
- Covers ALL pages: Landing (8 components), Spec Engine, Failure Analysis, Pricing, Auth Modal, Dashboard, History, Case Library, Feedback, Settings
- Exact copy, layout, spacing, colors for every component
- Saved as /workspace/gravix-v2/SPEC.md
- Key additions vs current: Social Proof Bar, "Why Not ChatGPT?" differentiator, Self-Learning AI feature block, 3-step How It Works, Pricing Preview
- First sub-agent (Sonnet 4.5) completed 85% — landing page, spec engine, pricing, dashboard, history, case library, settings
- Respawned on Opus 4.6 per Барин's preference for coding models
- Hero empty space bug: fixed min-h-screen → min-h-[60vh] on mobile

## Gluemasters Shopify — Marketing Review (~5:54 PM)
- Барин wants dual-audience approach (B2B + consumer) — this is intentional
- Proposed audience segmentation cards below hero
- Key issues: dead empty sections, fake sale pricing, no product differentiation, no visible reviews
- **Барин approved: "Build it in Shopify"**
- Shopify CLI auth keeps timing out (device codes expire before approval completes)
- Need to resolve auth — may need Theme Access password from admin panel instead

## Full Code Review + Fix Pass (~6:30-7:30 PM)
- Opus 4.6 code review found 8 critical, 16 major, 15 minor issues
- Key criticals: frontend↔backend schema mismatches (every API call would 422), Supabase SSR crash, localStorage-only usage tracking, plan limits mismatch (frontend 5 vs backend 2), broken auth callback, Stripe webhook swallowing errors
- All 8 criticals + 16 majors fixed in one pass, pushed commit 206e81e
- Created /privacy, /terms pages; removed dead code; wired PDF export, settings save, feedback
- Saved full audit to gravix-v2/CODE_REVIEW.md

## Known Bug: Auth Modal Login Not Working (~7:48 PM)
- Барин reports login doesn't work for any modal
- Needs investigation — likely related to C6 auth callback fix or Supabase config

## Open Items at EOD
- **AUTH BUG**: Login modal not working — needs immediate investigation
- **Shopify theme rebuild** — approved, blocked on CLI auth (try Theme Access password next)
- **Gravix backend**: api.gravix.com SSL cert not provisioned; backend live at gravix-prod.onrender.com
- **Env vars needed**: Anthropic API key on Render, Stripe price IDs for Pro/Team
- Jaan Malik tracking email not yet sent
- Product image overhaul (P0: missing thumbnails)
- Viscosity Finder Quiz upload to Shopify
- B2B outreach sequences (Cristaux + Crown)
