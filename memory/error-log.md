2026-02-16: Ev reported that a previous replacement shipment used SKUs that do not exist. Likely cause: ShipBob replacement order API created a NEW inventory item (e.g., 22374746) due to missing Package Preference (PackagePreferenceNotSet) instead of using the existing SKU/inventory (e.g., Thick inv 8696102). Need to ensure replacements reference existing ShipBob inventory IDs/SKUs and package preferences are set before creating replacements.
