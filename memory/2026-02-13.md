# 2026-02-13 Daily Notes

## Accelerator Bottle from Xtralok
- Ev sent photo of the pump accelerator bottle (white cylindrical HDPE, pump spray top)
- Photo saved: `/Users/evolve/.openclaw/media/inbound/file_242---fdf836b9-dbe3-4987-8111-38e5f0942d7f.jpg`
- Next step: Get exact dimensions (height, circumference) → send label brief to Designcoffers on Fiverr
- Designcoffers needs: text in Word doc, label dimensions, logo

## Multi-Agent Setup (11:30 AM - 12:00 PM)
- Gravix agent now runs as a second agent on the **same gateway** (not a separate gateway)
- Created new Telegram bot `@GravixAlex_bot` via BotFather (token stored in config)
- Config: two Telegram accounts (`main` → @GmVasyaBot, `gravix` → @GravixAlex_bot) with bindings routing to respective agents
- Agent-to-agent messaging enabled (`tools.agentToAgent.allow: ["main", "gravix"]`)
- Gravix agent workspace: `~/.openclaw/gravix-workspace/` (SOUL.md, briefing docs, SPEC.md all present)
- Gravix agent confirmed online, Opus 4.6, all context loaded
- Killed and cleaned up the old separate `ai.openclaw.gravix` LaunchAgent (was causing Telegram getUpdates 409 conflicts)
- **Key lesson:** `openclaw agents add` + multi-account Telegram is the right approach, NOT separate gateways. Separate gateways have lock conflicts, port issues, and the CLI `--profile` flag has bugs with `isLoaded` detection.

## Pump Accelerator Label — Designcoffers Hired (12:40 PM)
- Xtralok provided bottle dims: H 5¼", W 2", C 6¼", label size 3"×5"
- Generated Word doc with all label copy + dimensions
- Expanded scope: label + 7 Amazon listing images + 5 A+ Content modules + 3D mockups
- Researched Amazon image specs (2000×2000px, RGB, JPEG, <2MB, white BG main)
- Full design brief sent: `Pump-Accelerator-8oz-FULL-BRIEF.docx`
- **Designcoffers accepted — $450 for full package, 4-5 day turnaround**
- ETA: ~Feb 17-18 for first review

## Valentine's Day Restaurant Search
- Ev asked for best V-Day restaurant (Feb 14) in Seattle/Bellevue/Kirkland area
- Checked OpenTable, Tock extensively
- Most top spots sold out (Spinasse, Le Coin, Canlis rejected as "boring", Charlotte rejected, Ascend "sux")
- Available options shared: Crawlspace Gastropub (7pm, 4.8★), Imperial Kitchen (7:45pm), Hearth at Heathman Kirkland (phone), Copperleaf, Serafina, Elliott's
- Ev hasn't picked yet

## Gravix Agent Activity (autonomous, 2/13)
Per midday cron report, the gravix agent shipped 16 commits today:
- CI hardened: frontend checks, Playwright E2E, Python 3.14, branch protection
- CodeRabbit AI review config added
- 5 UI bug fixes: price mismatch, dashboard sort, mobile scroll lock, nav, loading UX
- 3 performance wins: auth waterfall bypass, session caching, backend warm + localStorage cache
- Critical fix: dashboard hang from optimistic auth-bypass deadlock
- 6 Playwright E2E tests added
- Feature: clickable analysis cards + descriptive display IDs
- Fixed: dashboard hover URL showing /feedback/ instead of /history/ (stretched Link overlay)

## Memory Maintenance (3:07 PM)
- Updated MEMORY.md: added multi-agent setup section, pump accelerator project, cleaned stale Gravix details (now owned by gravix agent), added lessons learned from 2/12-2/13
- Consolidated Gluemasters completed work vs open items
