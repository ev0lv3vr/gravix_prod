- Fixed dashboard redirect after sign-in (onAuthStateChange + setTimeout)
- Added auth guards on dashboard/history/settings
- Sign out redirects to home
- Added Dashboard to user dropdown menu + nav bar
- Made feedback banner + analysis rows clickable → /history
- Fixed React hooks violation (hooks after early return)

## ShipBob Invoice Correction
- Prerna (ShipBob case #02503592) requested Medium glue invoice instead of Thick
- Generated corrected invoice GM-2026-0211-01: Medium CA Glue 600 CPS, 32 units × $10.50 = $336.00
- Sent from evgueni@gluemasters.com
- Also fixed himalaya gluemasters account: added save-copy = false
