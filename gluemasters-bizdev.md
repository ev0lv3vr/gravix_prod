## Phase 1 — Immediate (Source from Xtralok, fast turnaround)

### 1. CA Debonder / Glue Remover
**Priority: 🔴 HIGHEST**

- **What:** Solvent gel that dissolves cured CA glue. Brush-cap applicator.
- **Why:** Every competitor sells one. #1 accessory purchased alongside CA glue. Completes the product ecosystem. Safety product (removes glue from skin).
- **Format:** 2oz bottle with brush cap (industry standard)
- **Competitor pricing:**
  - Starbond Debonder 2oz: **$12.00** retail (Hamilton Lee), ~$9.99 on Amazon
  - BSI Un-Cure 1oz: **$6.99**
  - Satellite City Super Solvent 2oz: **$7.50**
  - FastCap 2P-10 Debonder 2oz: **$9.99**
- **Suggested retail:** **$9.99** (2oz) — undercut Starbond, match FastCap
- **Estimated COGS:** $1.50-2.50 per unit (active ingredient: nitromethane or gamma-butyrolactone)
- **Margin:** ~75-85%
- **Action:** Ask Xtralok if they supply CA debonder formulations. If not, source from Cartell UK or Cyanotec (both offer private label CA accessories).
- **Shopify setup:** New product, add to Accelerator & Gel section, cross-sell on all CA product pages

### 2. Black CA Glue (Rubber-Toughened)
**Priority: 🔴 HIGH**

- **What:** Medium-thick CA (500 CPS) that dries jet black. Rubber-toughened for impact resistance.
- **Why:** Starbond's #1 specialty SKU. Sold at Rockler, Lee Valley, Amazon. Woodworkers need it for filling dark wood knots, voids, cracks. Also used in speaker repair, RC, guitar building.
- **Key differentiator:** Rubber-toughened = absorbs shock, flexes. Standard CA is brittle.
- **Format:** 2oz bottle (matches Starbond), potentially 8oz for pros
- **Competitor pricing:**
  - Starbond Black Medium-Thick 2oz: **$14.99**
  - BSI IC-2000 Black 1oz: **$8.49**
  - Infinity Bond CA-3080 Black: **$12.99**
- **Suggested retail:** **$14.99** (2oz), **$34.99** (8oz)
- **Estimated COGS:** $2.50-4.00 per 2oz (rubber-toughened additive + black pigment increases cost ~30% vs standard CA)
- **Margin:** ~70-80%
- **Action:** Confirm Xtralok can supply rubber-toughened + pigmented formulations. Most UK CA manufacturers offer this.
- **Shopify setup:** New product, add to main collection, cross-sell on woodworking landing page

### 3. Starter Kit / Bundle
**Priority: 🟡 MEDIUM (zero new sourcing)**

- **What:** Pre-packaged kit with Thin + Medium + Thick (2oz each) + Accelerator (2oz spray) + Debonder
- **Why:** Starbond sells a 3-bottle + activator bundle for $37.99. FastCap's 2P-10 Kit is their best seller. Gift-ready, reduces purchase decision friction.
- **Format:** Branded box, 5 items
- **Competitor pricing:**
  - Starbond 3-Glue + Activator Kit: **$37.99**
  - FastCap 2P-10 Complete Kit: **$39.99**
  - BSI Sample Pack + Accelerator: **$24.99**
- **Suggested retail:** **$39.99** (vs $55+ if bought separately at 2oz prices)
- **Estimated COGS:** Sum of individual 2oz costs + box ($1-2) — ~$12-15
- **Margin:** ~60-65% (lower due to discount, but higher AOV)
- **Action:** Design packaging. Can assemble in-house or at ShipBob. Need branded box designed.
- **Shopify setup:** New product, feature on homepage, gift guide potential

### 4. Precision Applicator Tips (Microtips)
**Priority: 🟡 MEDIUM**

- **What:** Replacement extension tips/microtips for precise CA application
- **Why:** Starbond includes these with every bottle. Separate packs sell well as repeat purchases. Near-zero cost to source.
- **Format:** Pack of 10-20 tips
- **Competitor pricing:**
  - Starbond Microtips 10-pack: **$4.99**
  - Generic CA tips Amazon: **$3.99-5.99** for 20-pack
- **Suggested retail:** **$5.99** (20-pack)
- **Estimated COGS:** $0.30-0.50 per pack
- **Margin:** ~90%+
- **Action:** Source from Alibaba/direct (polypropylene tips, commodity item). Can also ask Xtralok.

## Phase 2 — Medium-Term (requires formulation work)

### 5. Rubber-Toughened Clear CA (Flexible)
- BSI "Insta-Flex+" is a cult product in hobby/RC
- Clear version of rubber-toughened formula
- Big in RC cars, model aircraft, anything taking impact
- Retail: $8-12 for 1oz
- **Action:** Ask Xtralok about flexible/rubber-toughened clear formulation

### 6. Odorless / Low-Bloom CA
- Growing demand from jewelers, instrument makers, dark wood finishers
- Standard CA fumes cause "blooming" (white haze on surfaces)
- Ethyl → alkoxy cyanoacrylate substitution
- Premium pricing: 20-30% above standard CA
- **Action:** Check if Xtralok has an alkoxy-based formulation

### 7. 10oz Squeeze/Pump Bottle Format
- FastCap's 10oz is their workhorse format for production shops
- Current 16oz is value-leader but hard to dispense precisely
- New SKU format, not new chemistry
- **Action:** Source squeeze bottles with precision nozzle

---

## Phase 3 — Strategic

### 8. Baking Soda + CA Filler Kit
- Viral woodworking technique (thin CA + baking soda = instant filler)
- Kit: Thin CA 2oz + fine baking soda + mixing tray + instructions
- Content marketing goldmine (YouTube, blog)
- Retail: $19.99

### 9. Co-Brand: Tidal Gardens x Glue Masters Reef Glue
- Relationship already exists (they use our product, YouTube feature)
- Custom labeled Ultra Thin specifically for reef/aquascaping
- Distribution through tidalgardens.com + reef retailers
- Proven social proof (video with 100K+ views)
